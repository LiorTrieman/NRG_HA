# ---------Part 2 - genotyping data------------- #

""" The TAMU array was used to genotype hundreds of cotton varieties. Genotyping results are
provided in the file GT_AH_DiversityAnalysisDataforCottonGen.xlsx, which can be
downloaded from:
https://nrgene-candidatetask.s3.amazonaws.com/GT_AH_DiversityAnalysisDataforCottonGen.xlsx
In this section, weâ€™ll parse this file and extract some statistics. You may convert the xls into
a csv file for easier parsing.
1. Write a script that will read the genotyping file and outputs a file with commaseparated table. Each row of the table should represent one sample and have the
following information:
a. Sample name - e.g. AH-097
b. Sample ID (entry) - e.g. 392
c. Sample description (designation) - e.g. G. amourianum
d. Fraction of markers successfully genotyped - e.g. 0.92
e. Fraction of heterozygous genotypes (out of the successfully genotyped markers) -
e.g. 0.11
Ensure that genotypes match the possible alleles per marker, as defined in Part 1. If
you find mismatches, discard the genotype and issue an appropriate warning."""
